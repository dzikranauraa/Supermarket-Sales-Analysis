# Supermarket Sales Analysis

This is a self-driven data analytics project where I explored supermarket sales data throughout the first quarter of 2019 using SQL and built an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio. The goal of this project is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and uncover key business insights that can support data-driven decision making.
